# Topcoder problem solutions in Python

![](https://github.com/lokeshh/topcoder_sol/workflows/BasicTest/badge.svg)

**Purpose of this repo is to store solution of all topcoder problems in python 3.7. 
I will try to solve one problem per day to improve my competitive programming skills and helps others to look for solution in a easy to understand language i.e. Python.**

- If you want a problem solved, feel free to create an issue.
- If you find solution to a problem unclear, create an issue and I will add comments to it.
